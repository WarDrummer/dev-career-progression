# StringBuilder Workshop

* Given a large text file: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
* Write a method that uses StringBuilder to concatenate the contents into a single, ;-delimited line
* Write another method that does the same thing without StringBuilder (using string concatenation)
*	Time each method using a simple timer and compare
* Using a performance profiler, quantify the performance difference between the two methods
* Using a memory profiler, quantify the memory usage difference between the two methods
* Implement the StringBuilder class (for appending strings only)
